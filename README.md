# Machine-Learning
Solution of Udacity Intro to Machine Learning Final Project

Here p.py and p2.py are essentially poi_id.py. Different file are present just for the purpose to try different pieces of code and compare the ouput. AddingFeature.py creates a class and has been imported. Also the feature_format.py has been imported from tools folder provided by Udacity.

The program tries many different algorithms with and without GridSearchCV to tune parameters. The various algorithms have been commented. So to test them just uncomment.
